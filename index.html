        <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <h2> Introduction</h2>
                <h3> Why Software Development?</h3>
                    <P> I've been learning software development for the past year or so,
                    and have been slowly but surely enjoying the process. What started off as an effort to make <em> more money </em>
                    has turned into a potential new hobby! Right now I'm still learning HTML, but we'll see how things go.</P>
            <h2> What's Next? </h2>
                    <P> I'm going to continue to learning Software Development and see where the process takes me! Next is CSS, then JS...</P>
            <h2> About Me...</h2>
                <h3> Fitness, Music, Fashion & More... </h3>
                    <P> Outside of learning new technical skills to achieve financial freedom, fitness, music and fashion have been the biggest
                        pastimes in my life. I love the gym, have been getting into yoga as of late, and am working towards achieving a leaner physique.
                        Music is my life, I can't stop listening to this one Chris Brown song named <strong> Beautiful People </strong> ... that shit is a bop!
                        Fashion is the final obsession as of late. I love clothes and style, and one goal of mine is to partake in modeling.. hence the lean physique.
                        Besides modeling, my favorite style related objects / fashion pieces as of late include flowy relaxed fit pants, ASICS / NB runners, and the classic
                        Sambas... we'll that's me!
                        </P>
                <h3> Work </h3>
                    <p> During my 9-5, I work in consulting for a firm called FTI. I'm not gonna lie, it's a cool company. Solid pay,
                        chill coworkers, not too hectic on the work front. Obviously it's a bit annoying, like all things, but for the most part
                        I enjoy my job. However... if I'm able to do this development shit and make some money? See ya!
